# Stream Of Money â€“ Blueberry Rails project

What is working
* Logging in
* Loading invoices via API
* Adding/modifying expenses for each invoice line

Nice to have features
* Price list - would be great to be able to pick expenses from list of predefined items
* Stats - some basics stats about how does/doesn't the business flourish
